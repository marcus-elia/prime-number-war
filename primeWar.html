	<h2> Overview</h2>
	<p> This is a single player game where you compete against the computer. You are on the
	    left side of the screen, and the computer is on the right.  In the middle, there are 63
	    hexagons that have random integers on them.  
	    The object of the game is to have the highest score when there are no hexagons left.
	</p>
	<h2> Points </h2>
	<p> You score points by launching missiles and hitting hexagons.  When a missile hits a hexagon,
	    the hexagon and the missile are both destroyed.  If the number on the hexagon was prime, you
	    gain that number of points.  If the number was composite, that number gets added to each of
	    the hexagons bordering the hexagon you just hit.  If a number becomes greater than 100, it wraps
	    back around.  So 95 + 16 makes 11.
	</p>
	<p> If your missile hits the computer and it currently has more points than you, you steal one third
	    of the difference between your point values.  For example, if you have 100 points and the computer 
	    has 130 points, you will gain 10 and the computer will lose 10.  The same applies if the computer's
	    missile hits you.  If two missiles collide, they will both be destroyed. You can use this to
	    defend yourself.
	</p>
	<h2> Controls </h2>
	<p> You can move up and down with the W and S keys, respectively.  At any time, you can launch a missile
	    by clicking on the screen. The missile will be launched from your location toward the spot where you
	    clicked.  If you click while you already have a missile, the previous missile will vanish and a new
	    one will be launched. You can steer your missiles using the A and D keys.  Holding A will make it
	    curve counterclockwise, and holding D will make it curve clockwise.
	</p>
	<h2> The Computer </h2>
	<p> Each of the characters has a different personality.  Some are easier to beat than others. Hint:
	    Cookie Monster isn't very good.
